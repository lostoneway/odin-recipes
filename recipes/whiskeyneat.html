    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't love whiskey? Sometimes ice and mixers just get in the way.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Some gud, gud. Whiskey of course. Tennessee in this case!</li>
        <li>Glassware</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place clean glass on counter.</li>
        <li>Open bottle of your finest Tennessee whiskey.
            <ul>
                <li>Fun fact! If the spirit is made in Kentucky, it's Bourbon. But if its made in Tennessee, it's
                    Whiskey.</li>
                <li>That's just what I heard from my wife. I didn't make the rules. She's from Kentucky so I believe
                    her.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Go ahead, wrap two fingers around the glass and pour the whiskey until you reach the top of your second
            finger.</li>
        <li>Give it a moment and allow the whiskey to breathe.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
